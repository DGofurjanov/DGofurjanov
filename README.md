- 👋 Hi, I’m @DGofurjanov
- 👀 I’m hardly interested in Flutter now. but I don't know if I could handle it;)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to resolve a bunch of unexpected errors and fight against them violently:)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my nonsense project as it is called "How to run an emulator without Android Studio"
- 📫 How to reach me is quite straightforward, but I recommend not to do so.
- 😄 Pronouns: Me and Mine
- ⚡ Fun fact: Why is Flutter taught mostly by Indian developers?))))
